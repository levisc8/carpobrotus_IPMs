## Introduction

1. Aizoaceae contains XXX plant species, yet there are no structured demographic studies of any of them. 
    
    + Contains XXX invasive plant species, and XXX rare/endangered species. Structured demographic studies are needed to facilitate syntheses and conservation assessments. 
    
2. Invasions are demoraphic processes whereby spread is determined by biotic, abiotic factors **and** invader vital rates/life history traits (applicable across local and regional scales).
    
    + Carpobrotus spp. are globally invasive and a proper understanding of mechanisms requires a demographic knowledge base. 
    
    + Carpobrotus management can be quite expensive and labor intensive (e.g. manual removal)
    
    + Chemical methods work, but are generally frowned upon
    
    + Finding optimal balance is possible w/ sensitivity/elasticity analysis
