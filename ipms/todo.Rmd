# TODO

1. Lambdas for Israel + foxton are trash - go back to raw data, then vital rate models, then IPM code, and see what's going on. 

2. Whenever that is figured out, stack the LTRE by site (just make columns for site intercept_surv/grow/etc), and then RF() everything at once!

3. Remember - cross site analysis is most important (to Tiffany), so don't keep doing single site stuff if you can (except for the actual IPM).
