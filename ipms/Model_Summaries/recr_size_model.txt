Intercept only, varies across populations

 *********************

 Family: gaussian 
  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity 
Formula: log_size_next ~ 1 
   Data: recruits (Number of observations: 15) 
  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 1000; warmup = 0; thin = 1;
         total post-warmup draws = 4000

Population-Level Effects:

Intercept    -8.62      0.14    -8.91    -8.34 1.00     1685     1566

Family Specific Parameters: 
      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS
sigma     0.54      0.12     0.37     0.84 1.00     1800     1777

Draws were sampled using sample(hmc). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS
and Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential
scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).
