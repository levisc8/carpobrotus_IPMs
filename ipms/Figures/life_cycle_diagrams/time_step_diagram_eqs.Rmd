## Transitions

1. plant -> plant $s(z) * g(z', z)$

2. plant -> fruit $p_r(z) * S(z) * f_n(z) * p_m * p_{f_v}$

3. fruit -> seedling $n_f * p_e * g_i * v_s$

4. fruit -> seed bank $n_f * (1-g_i) * v_s$

5. seedling -> plant $s_s * f_d(z')$

6. seed bank -> seedling $s_{sb} * g_{sb} * p_e$

7. seed bank -> seed bank $s_{sb} * (1 - g_{sb})$


## Glossary and data sets

- $s(z)$: survival ~ size

  - Data: drone mapping

- $g(z',z)$: size (*t+1*) conditional on survival

  - Data: drone mapping

- $p_r(z)$: Probability of flowering ~ size

  - Data: drone mapping

- $f_n(z)$: Flower number conditional on flowering

  - Data: drone mapping

- $p_m$: Proportion of flowers at *t* that make it to *t + 1*

  - Data: Sum of total fruits in seed density data set, scaled to actual plant area

- $p_{f_v}$: Proportion of fruits that make it to *t + 1* that are still viable (e.g. $1 - abortion\_rate$)

  - Data: sum of mature fruits in seed density data set divided by $p_m$

- $f_d(z')$: Recruit size distribution

  - Data: drone mapping
  
- $g_i$: germination rate of fresh seeds

  - data: need to talk to Erola
  
    - DONE for SA, NZ, PT
      
      - Covid fucked ESP and USA
    
- $v_s$: total seed viability

  - data: need to talk to Erola
  
  - DONE for all except CA and Israel, have for Spain, but other sites, not ours
  
- $n_f$: mean number of seeds per surviving mature fruit

  - data: Erola
  
    - Done for Spain, SA, NZ, PT
  
- $p_e$: probability that a viable seed that germinates establishes

  - data: Maybe Erola? I really don't know about this one. Consider using transfer function or something
  
  - Literature
  
- $s_s$: seedling survival

  - data: seedling survey plots from Rooisand (no others available). This is THIN
  
- $s_{sb}$: seed bank survival probability

  - data: need to talk to Erola
  
    - Not really, just simulate instead
  
- $g_{sb}$: seed bank germination probability

  - data: need to talk to Erola
  
    - Not really, artificial aging experiments don't use, just simulate instead.
