# Carpobrotus drone analyses

Carpobrotus spp. analyses parameterized with data derived from
drone-based photography. There are 3 main projects:

1.  `Ana_Israel_IPM`: contains data and R code to implement an IPM for
    the Israeli subset of the complete data set. This manuscript is in
    revision at `PLoSOne` currently. [Preprint
    link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.08.415174v1.full)

2.  `repro_analysis`: contains data and R code to perform a global
    analysis of environmental drivers of probability of reproducing and
    total flower production. There are 21 sites from 6 countries
    spanning the native and invaded range (see below). This manuscript
    is in progress, but not yet submitted.

    -   South Africa (native, 6 sites)

    -   New Zealand (invaded, 6 sites)

    -   Spain (invaded, 2 sites)

    -   Portugal (invaded, 3 sites)

    -   Israel (invaded, 1 site)

    -   United States (invaded, 3 sites)

3.  `ipms`: contains data and R code to implement environmentally
    explicit IPMs for 13 sites in 3 countries (due to the Covid-19
    pandemic, re-sampling could not be completed in Spain or USA).
    Further analyses are going to get added at some point, but I’m not
    totally sure when. This is not submitted yet either. Sites are as
    follows:

    -   South Africa (native, 6 sites)

    -   New Zealand (invaded, 5 sites)

    -   Portugal (invaded, 2 sites)

Each project contains its own README file to help understand what’s
going on.
