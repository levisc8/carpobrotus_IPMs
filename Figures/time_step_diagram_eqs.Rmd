## Transitions

1. plant -> plant $s(z) * g(z', z)$

2. plant -> fruit $p_r(z) * S(z) * f_n(z) * p_m * p_{f_v}$

3. fruit -> seedling $n_f * f_d(z')$


## Glossary and data sets
- $s(z)$: survival ~ size

  - Data: drone mapping

- $g(z',z)$: size (*t+1*) conditional on survival

  - Data: drone mapping

- $p_r(z)$: Probability of flowering ~ size

  - Data: drone mapping

- $f_n(z)$: Flower number conditional on flowering

  - Data: drone mapping

- $p_m$: Proportion of flowers at *t* that make it to *t + 1*

  - Data: Sum of total fruits in seed density data set, scaled to actual plant area

- $p_{f_v}$: Proportion of fruits that make it to *t + 1* that are still viable (e.g. $1 - abortion\_rate$)

  - Data: sum of mature fruits in seed density data set divided by $p_m$

- $f_d(z')$: Recruit size distribution

  - Data: drone mapping
