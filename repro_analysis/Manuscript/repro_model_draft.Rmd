## Introduction

Invasive species are an increasing threat to global biodiversity blah blah blah

## Introduction - Old

Mediterranean coastal dune systems are particularly threatened by the collective scourge of human-mediated habitat destruction, invasive species, and climate change. Species in the *Carpobrotus* genus (Aizoaceae), specifically *Carpobrotus edulis* and *Carpobrotus acinaciformis*, represent one the of the largest individual threats to this ecotype. *C edulis* and *C. acinaciformis* are native to South Africa, but have been introduced to five other continents and are considered invasive in at least one region of each one (CABI 2020). Introductions in the California and New Zealand represent substantially cooler and wetter climate than the South African climate they evolved in (Figure 1 occurrence \~ clim figure). Nevertheless, these *Carpobrotus.* species have established, spread, and come to dominate these areas (Vila et al. 2006, Santoro et al. 2012, Fried et al. 2014).

A critical part of the invasion process is the ability to reproduce and spread at both local and regional scales. *C. edulis* and *C. acinaciformis* reproduce both sexually and asexually (Suehs et al. 2004). Reproduction through seed dispersal is critical during the spread phase of plant invasions, as it facilitates longer distance dispersal and establishment in new areas than vegetative reproduction can. Furthermore, cross-pollination with con-specifics enhances genetic diversity, which may be lacking due to founder effects in the invading population. *C. edulis* and *C. acinaciformis* have a highly flexible mating system, including the ability to produce apomictic seeds, self-pollination, and cross-pollination (Campoy et al. 2018), with *C. edulis* showing more plasticity than *C. acinaciformis* (Suehs et al. 2004). Furthermore, multiple species of mammals are known to consume and disperse seeds of these species, in some cases up to 800m from the parent plant (D'Antonio, Odion, & Tyler 1993, Vila & D'Antonio 1998, Bourgeois et al. 2005, Novoa et al. 2012).

Demographic processes are critical to invasions - successful invasions require individuals to survive, grow, and reproduce in their novel environments. Environmental variables are generally stochastic, and climate change is predicted to shift their distributions. In order to predict invasions under future climate scenarios, we need to show (i) whether climate affects species' vital rates and (ii) the direction of an effect if it is present. Recent work has shown thermal niche shifts in *Carpobrotus spp.* between the native to invasive range (Fenollosa & Bosch 2018), and variation in seeds/fruit (Suehs et al 2004, Vila et al. 1998). Furthermore, there is a connection between flower density, pollen-mediated gene flow, and degree of hybridization/hybrid vigor in *C. edulis* and *C. acinaciformis* (Suehs et al. 2006). However, the mean and variance of total reproductive potential, and the relationship of these quantities to climatic variables, is still an open question. We specifically focus on the vital rates underlying sexual reproduction - the probability of flowering and the number of flowers produced by flowering individuals. We test whether climate (and maybe native status??) drive differences in probability of flowering and average flower production across the native and invaded range, controlling for individual- and site-specific differences.

## Methods

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

library(fs)
library(dplyr)

fps <- dir_ls("../../Data/Genetics/")

all_gen_data <- lapply(fps,
                       function(x) read.csv(x)) %>%
  do.call(what = "rbind", args = .)

mu_fl_width <- mean(all_gen_data$Flw_wid_all, na.rm = TRUE)
se_fl_width <- 
  sd(all_gen_data$Flw_wid_all, na.rm = TRUE) /
  sqrt(sum(!is.na(all_gen_data$Flw_wid_all)))


mu_ur_width <- mean(all_gen_data$Flw_wid_fill, na.rm = TRUE)
se_ur_width <- 
  sd(all_gen_data$Flw_wid_fill, na.rm = TRUE) /
  sqrt(sum(!is.na(all_gen_data$Flw_wid_fill)))

```

### Data Collection

We collected data on multiple *Carpobrotus* species throughout their global geographic and climate range from spring 2018 - spring 2019. Sites were selected based on population density and ability to get permission from local governing authorities (Table 1). *Carpobrotus spp.* grow via spreading outward, and so surface area is likely the most readily collectable measure to predict vital rates. Here, we describe the general methods to apply to all populations. Site-specific alterations/additions to the methodology are available in the ESM.

We collected demographic data using drones to capture high-resolution imagery of populations. Areas sampled ranged from 0.5-4ha. At each site, the sampling area was delineated using DJI GroundStation Pro (SZ DJI Technology Co.) for iPad (Apple Inc.). This applications provides functionality for users to generate polygons over the area of interest and computes the optimal flight path given a desired orthomosaic resolution, degree of image overlap, and drone-specific camera parameters. We also placed multiple targets of known size throughout each sampling area so that we could ground truth our size estimates from the resulting orhtomosaics. We generated flight paths with resolutions between 2 and 5 mm/pixel in the resulting orthomosaics (Table 1). The average width of flowers in our data set is `r mu_fl_width` $\pm$ `r se_fl_width` cm, and unripe fruits is `r mu_ur_width`\$ \pm \$ `r se_ur_width` (SC Levin, unpublished data). We are therefore confident that these resolutions were adequate to capture reproductive effort. All imagery was collected with a -90$^\circ$ camera angle (nadir imagery).

```{r table 1, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

all_sites <- read.csv("../Data/all_sites_clim.csv") %>%
  select(Site, Lat, Lon) %>%
  filter(!Site %in% c("Omaha", "Pt_Reyes", "Fort_Ord")) %>%
  mutate(Lat = round(Lat, 2),
         Lon = round(Lon, 2),
         Res = NA_real_) %>%
  setNames(c("Site", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Orthomosaic Resolution (mm)")) %>%
  knitr::kable()


print(all_sites)

```

Once flight plans were prepared and permission was obtained from both local governing authorities as well as any relevant air traffic control, flights were conducted with a DJI Phantom 4 Pro v1. Nearly all flights were operated automatically with DJI Ground Station Pro, but sometimes manual flights were needed to adjust for excess terrain variation (see ESM). Transects were flown across populations, usually between 10AM and 2PM local time to minimize shadows. Most flights were too long to be completed using a single battery. Generally, when the battery level reached 20%, the mission was paused to land the drone and swap batteries. We then used the "Resume Mission from Last Waypoint" functionality to continue image collection.

We processed all images for a single population using Pix4DMapper (Pix4D SA, 2019). We generated georeferenced orthomosiac composite images. Using QGIS 3.4 (QGIS Development Team), we then created a polygon layer for each distinct *Carpobrotus* ramet, and a point layer to count the number of flowers and unripe fruits on each ramet. Additionally, we drew polygons around the each ground truth target we had placed in the population, and computed the ratio of $\frac{True Size}{Measured Size}$, which was used to re-scale the measured size for each *Carpobrotus* ramet.

### Species occurrence and weather data

We downloaded occurrence data for *Carpobrotus spp.* from GBIF on September 18, 2020. The search was restricted to records that had coordinates and no known geospatial issues (see ESM for full JSON API query). Once downloaded, we further cleaned the occurrence data using the `CoordinateCleaner` *R* package (Zizka et al. 2019). Specifically, we removed records which had coordinate uncertainty greater than 5km, as well as records from botanical gardens and national capitals, national centroids, and coordinates over oceans (island coordinates were still retained).

Additionally, we downloaded gridded monthly weather data from WorldClim for 2010-2018 (Fick and Hijmans, 2017). We computed raster layers for mean annual temperature ($\mu_T$), temperature seasonality ($T_{seas}$), temperature coldest month ($T_{cm}$), temperature coldest quarter ($T_{cq}$), mean annual precipitation ($\mu_P$), and precipitation seasonality ($P_{seas}$) from 2016-2018 using the `biovars` function from the `dismo` *R* package (Hijmans et al. 2020). Once computed, we extracted values for each climate covariate for every retained GBIF occurrence point, as well as our field sites (Figure 1). Additionally, we extracted values for minimum temperature $T_{min}$, maximum temperature $T_{max}$, and precipitation at monthly timescales going from January 2016 - December 2018. These were used separately to test for lagged effects of climate variables on flowering probability and flower production.

### Data analysis

Generalized linear mixed effects models were first fit using the averaged WorldClim values and the natural logarithm of surface area as predictors, and flowering and number of flowers conditional on reproduction as responses (logit and log links, respectively). In addition to these models, we tested for lagged climate effects using the monthly data for temperature and precipitation values. Specifically, we fit models with monthly values of $T_{min}$, $T_{max}$, and total precipitation with horseshoe priors to regularize monthly coefficients that were not useful.

The best models were selected using LOOIC and checked graphically using posterior predictive checks (ESM Figures XYZ). Once the best models were selected, we used the model predictions to compute the mean ($\bar\omega(z, \theta)$) and variance of flower number ($Var(\omega(z, \theta))$) (Eqs 1 & 2). Size of first flowering was computed as the size at which a ramet produced $\ge 1$ flower. 

$$\bar\omega(z,\theta)) = p_f(z,\theta) * r_f(z,\theta).$$  {#eq:eqn1}

$$Var(\omega(z,\theta)) = \bar\omega(z,\theta) + \frac{1 - p_f(z,\theta)}{p_f(z,\theta)}*\bar\omega(z,\theta).$$  {#eq:eqn2}

Model predictions were then used to generate maps of reproductive suitability as a function of climate.

*Red triangles are our field sites, and black dots are GBIF records for Carpobrotus edulis, Carpobrotus acinaciformis, and Carpobrotus chilensis. Weather data is from WorldClim and is averaged over 2016-2018. The point here is to understand how well we cover the recent climate distributions with our field sites. Variables are mean annual temperature (mat_rec), temperature seasonality (t_seas_rec), mean temperature of coldest month (t_co_mo_rec), mean temperature of coldest quarter (t_co_qu_rec), mean annual precip (map_rec), and precip seasonality (p_seas_rec). The upper triangle shows correlations between pairs of variables. I didn't really want that in the figure, but `ggpairs` does it by default and I haven't figured out how to turn it off. You can probably ignore that. The density plots on the diagonal show the density of points in each group. The pink is the density of GBIF occurrences for a given variable, and the green is the density of our field sites. I am not sure why those got different colors from the scatterplots, but again, I can't figure out how to change that.*
